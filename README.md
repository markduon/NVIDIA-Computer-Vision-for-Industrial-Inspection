# NVIDIA-Computer-Vision-for-Industrial-Inspection
This is a hands-on workshop organized by The NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute (DLI) and The SMART Infrastructure Facility.

Learn how to design, train, test, and deploy a hardware-accelerated manufacturing defect detection pipeline for industrial inspection using deep learning-based computer vision techniques.

### This is broken down into three main parts:
1. Automated Optical Inspection and Data Exploration
2. Model Training with Transfer Learning
3. Model Deployment for Inference
